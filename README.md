### Project Description: Holiday-Driven Consumer Insight Analysis of Engagement on Social Media Across Brands
---
Through the final project, we will explore some driving questions:

1) Does consumer sentiments increase or decrease around holidays for different brands?
2) How does social media engagement correlate with holiday-specific advertising expenditures?
3) Can we classify whether a day is “holiday period” vs “normal period” through sentiment and engagement analysis?
4) Is it possible to cluster brands into groups based on holiday sentiment patterns?
5) How to forecast brand perception around holidays using time-series models?
6) Can neural networks predict sentiment numeric WRDS metrics (ANN regression), classification of holiday vs nonholiday periods (ANN classification), and textual news headlines from RavenPack (ANN NLP model)?

### Purpose
This project analyzes how consumer sentiment, engagement, and behavior toward major brands shift around holidays and seasonal events (such as Black Friday, Christmas, Super Bowl, or Valentine's Day) by using a combination of social media data, advertising expenditure, and market performance from WRDS datasets (RavenPack) and Google Trends.

The final project integrates econometrics, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, time-series forecasting, and modern neural networks in order to visualize holiday-driven shifts in consumption, predicting consumer engagement, grouping brands by holiday season performance, and forecasts brand reputation over time, as well as analyzes news headlines/social buzz with NLP neural networks.
